Project Overview
This project aims to identify deepfake content in videos or images by leveraging deep learning models. Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person's likeness is replaced with someone else's, often using generative adversarial networks (GANs). This detector helps in distinguishing real from manipulated content.

Features
Deepfake Detection: Identify deepfake videos and images.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line or web interface for uploading and analyzing media.

Customizable Models: Supports training and inference with different architectures.

Batch Processing: Analyze multiple files at once.

Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepfakeDetector.git
cd DeepfakeDetector
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Make sure you have a requirements.txt file with all necessary packages.)

Usage
Run the Detector

bash
python detect.py --input path/to/your/video_or_image
Replace path/to/your/video_or_image with your file path.

Web Interface (if available)

bash
python app.py
Open your browser to http://localhost:5000 and upload a file.

Dataset
Training Data: Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) Dataset or similar.

Data Preprocessing: Scripts included for resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Architecture
Backbone: ResNet, EfficientNet, or custom CNN.

Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy.

Optimizer: Adam or SGD.

(Include a brief summary of your modelâ€™s architecture here, or a diagram if possible.)

Results
Accuracy: XX% on validation set.

Precision/Recall: XX% / XX% (if available).

Sample Output: Example screenshots or logs.
